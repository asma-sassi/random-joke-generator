**Random Joke Generator**

Random Joke Generator is a simple web application that fetches and displays random jokes from an API. With just a click of a button, users can enjoy a random joke from a variety of categories. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the JokeAPI to retrieve jokes.

**Features**

Random Jokes: Get a new joke every time you click the "Get New Joke" button.
User-friendly Interface: Clean and simple design that is easy to navigate.
Responsive: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
No Backend: The app fetches jokes directly from the JokeAPI, meaning there is no server-side code involved.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and layout of the app.
JavaScript: Logic for fetching and displaying random jokes.
JokeAPI: API used to fetch random jokes.
How It Works
The app fetches a random joke from the JokeAPI when the page is loaded.
When the user clicks the "Get New Joke" button, the app sends a request to the API for another random joke.
The fetched joke is displayed on the page in a user-friendly format.
The app works across different devices and screen sizes, providing a responsive experience.
